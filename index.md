Intrigued by how viruses interact with their vectors, are transmitted to vertebrate hosts. The Petit lab believe that understanding the virus-host interactions and co-evolution will enlight solution to decrease or stop tick-borne virus dissemination.
Therefore we focus on developing a System Virology (Transcriptomics, Proteomics and more...) to get an unbiased view of the relationship of tick cells and their viruses.
Tools remains scarce so we are joining forces with team in the UK (DSTL, CVR Glasgow..) and abroad to move faster towards sustainable solution against tick-borne emerging viruses!
