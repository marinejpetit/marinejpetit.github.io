Intrigued by how viruses impact their host, I have focussed my career on understanding interactions between viruses and their hosts/vectors using System Virology (Transcriptomics, Proteomics and more...).

Arboviruses have been my best companion through my journey from Institut Pasteur, Paris (Drosophila melanogaster piRNAs are not antiviral) to the University of California, Davis (Interaction between human transcription machinery and Dengue 2 virus NS5 protein). 

My Marie-Curie fellowship is the chance to continue exploring arboviruses biology focusing on tick-bunyavirus interactions. (* *This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 890970* *)
