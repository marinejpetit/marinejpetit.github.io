## Short Description

I am Marine Petit, a french scientist interested by neglected disease studies.
Throughout my career I had the chance to leave in 3 different countries, France, California,USA, and Scotland.
Currently based in Glasgow I am studying the interactions between tick and their viruses, with a focus on the emerging Bunyavorus SFTSV (Severe Fever with Thrombocypenia symptoms virus). By developing new tools and system virology approaches adapted to the tick vector I decipher the important pathway for the infection of tick cells.

Outside the lab I am passionate about music and literature. I also love to get lost in nature and observe fauna and flora!
And as many french people I am a food lover ! 


## TICKITS my MSCA Research -- June 2021-2023

Ticks are vectors of several emergent and re-emergent arboviruses across the world representing an important public health threat. The recent rise of tick-borne virus diseases in human population is associated with the impact of global warming on tick population and life cycle. To prevent such infections, we need novel vector-based control strategies requiring a better understanding of vector-virus interactions at the molecular level.

My research project focusses on the characterization of intra-cellular interactions between Dabie bandavirus (SFTSV) and one of the tick vectors responsible for virus transmission in Asia, Rhipicephalus microplus. Following its emergence in 2009, Dabie bandavirus rapidly spread through Southeast Asian countries with a 30% lethality rate. Its viral detection in R. microplus added to the availability of R. microplus cell lines (BME/CMTV6) affords us a unique opportunity to unravel bunyavirus-tick cell interactions.
