## ACOUS-TICK - 2024-2025
In 2024â€“2025, I work with Boris Allenou a sound artist which won the Fellowship by the Institute of Advanced Research at the University of Surrey, Guildford. Boris Allenou did a one year residency in the Petit lab to complete the sound piece ACOUS-TICK.

Together we have been focusing on developing a sonification model and a creative piece of music that captures the hidden impact of global warming on the UK tick species Ixodes ricinus.

Understanding the dynamics and population shifts of ticks is essential for designing effective control strategies. This Fellowship explores those dynamics through an unconventional lens, combining mathematical modelling with field recordings to compose a musical sentence that represents the ideal lifecycle of a tick. This sentence can then be altered by adjusting environmental parameters, producing the first sonic interpretation of how climate change may affect tick populations. In doing so, the work aims to offer an artistic yet data-informed model that could, in time, help us grasp local and global fluctuations in tick ecology.

## Reporting Tick in the UK (program led by the Brennan lab Group in CVR Glasgow Uni)
Through outreach conference (online or in person) we explain the importance of the tick, and their pathogens.
The recent increase of tick density is closely related to the global warming, 
consequently tick encounter more human and increase the risk of tick-borne pathogens transmission.
If you want to know more or report a tick bite, please visit : [TCV Scotland]("https://www.tcv.org.uk/scotland/what-makes-viruses-tick") 

## Kids oriented Outreach

I developed in patnership with MerrySTEM (Dr. Denise ) a set of activities to explain to kids (6-10 years old) the biology of tick-virus interactions.
Using different game plays we went from the DNA structure to the protein synthesis and the effect of a viral infection.
This activities intend to give access to science to kids in Scotland country side.
