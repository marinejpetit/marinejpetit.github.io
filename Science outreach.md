## Reporting Tick in the UK (program led by the Brennan lab Group in CVR Glasgow Uni)
Through outreach conference (online or in person) we explain the importance of the tick, and their pathogens.
The recent increase of tick density is closely related to the global warming, 
consequently tick encounter more human and increase the risk of tick-borne pathogens transmission.
If you want to know more or report a tick bite, please visit : [TCV Scotland]("https://www.tcv.org.uk/scotland/what-makes-viruses-tick") 
## Kids oriented Outreach

I developed in patnership with MerrySTEM (Dr. Denise ) a set of activities to explain to kids (6-10 years old) the biology of tick-virus interactions.
Using different game plays we went from the DNA structure to the protein synthesis and the effect of a viral infection.
This activities intend to give access to science to kids in Scotland country side.
